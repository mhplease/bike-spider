# bike-spider
scrape, process, and present CL used bike prices

Bike Spider is a project for looking at used bike prices on CL. It's broken down into a few different parts for simlicity:
1. bike databaser - pulls down all the current listing titles and prices from US CL.
2. bike make tagger - runs through the listing databse, searches all the titles and tags them with top bike brands
3. bike data plotter - plots the data
